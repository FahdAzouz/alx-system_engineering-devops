# Web Service Outage Postmortem: Database Overload Incident

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** The outage lasted from 09:00 to 12:00 UTC, March 15, 2024.
- **Impact:** Approximately 65% of users experienced timeouts, slow page loads, and intermittent errors, primarily affecting dashboard access.
- **Root Cause:** A database overload caused by an inefficient query from a recent feature release, leading to excessive CPU and memory usage.

## Timeline

- **09:05 UTC** - High database CPU usage alerts were triggered.
- **09:10 UTC** - Detected by monitoring alerts; initial assessment by DevOps.
- **09:20 UTC** - Service slowdown observed; initial investigation focused on web servers and load balancers.
- **09:45 UTC** - Increase in user complaints noted by customer support.
- **10:00 UTC** - Shifted focus to database following network issue exclusion; high load confirmed.
- **10:30 UTC** - Inefficient query identified as the cause; linked to new feature.
- **11:00 UTC** - Escalated to the development team responsible for the feature.
- **11:30 UTC** - Temporary fix applied by reverting the feature release.
- **12:00 UTC** - Service fully restored; post-incident review planned.

## Root Cause and Resolution

The primary cause was a database overload from an inefficient query related to a new feature, inadequately optimized for large data volumes. The temporary resolution involved reverting the feature release to alleviate database stress, followed by a hotfix that optimized the problematic query, tested, and redeployed without further issues.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

To mitigate future outages and ensure service reliability, we propose the following measures:

- **Query Optimization Processes:** Enhance code review processes for database-heavy features.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Introduce specific query performance monitoring for early detection.
- **Load Testing:** Mandatory production-like data load testing for all new releases.
- **Database Performance Tuning:** Regular sessions to maintain database efficiency under load.
- **Incident Response Training:** Frequent drills to improve the team's incident management capabilities.

## Tasks List

- [ ] Code review guidelines improvement focusing on database performance.
- [ ] Query performance metrics monitoring expansion.
- [ ] Production-like data load testing integration in CI/CD for new releases.
- [ ] Quarterly database optimization and tuning.
- [ ] Bi-monthly incident response drills for engineering teams.

This postmortem outlines the March 15 outage's causes, resolution efforts, and future prevention plans. Our commitment to reliability and transparency drives our continuous improvement efforts.
